here was developed a phase shift magnetic sensor system composed of two sets of coils , amplifiers , and phase shifts for sensing and output .
this is a feedback circuit shifting resonance frequency by chang of input signal phase , which can detect change of magnetic features of an object present at a center of two coils on high sensitivity and resolution .
for the coils , here were used two coils with 6mm of inner diameter and 800 of coil number by inversely connecting .
on a test , it was possible to analyze features of city water , pure water , city water treated by magnetized device by changing frequency .
and , it was confirmed to enable also to detect change of flow rate and volume .
here was described a high sensitivity strain sensor using the surface acoustic waves ( saw ) for radio frequency ic tag ( rfid ) and sensor network , to numerically discuss a strain testing meathod observing saw resonant fequency ( saw-rf ) shifts caused by the strain .
when supposing saw-rf and frequency resolution to 1ghz and 0.1hz , respectively , it could be calculated that detectable strain was 10-10 .
and , here was designed an saw sensor with 40mhz of resonant frequency , to prepare it on a quartz substrate by micromachining method .
as a result , it was found that its minimum detection strain was 10-5 .
here was proposed a real-time phase stamp range finder ( rt-psrf ) using three-phase correlation image sensor ( 3pcis ) .
if removing a 3pcis and a three-phase reference signal generator from rt-psrf , it is composed of the same parts as those of the conventional optical stripe range finder .
on rt-psrf , during single scanning using a sheet beam , phase of the reference signal is stamped at a moment where the optical stripes are photographed on every pixcels .
by converting the phase detected by such a method to angle of projected sheet beam , there can be obtained three-dimensional shapes of the object in real time .
hence , when comparing it with that using time-stamp vlsi range finder , psrf can avoid effect of spatial ununiformity of surface reflection and background illun\mination of the object .
and , the proposed psrf has simpler structure than that of modulated psrf .
